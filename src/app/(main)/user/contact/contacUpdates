Email Verification Status:
The current implementation shows a verified status with a checkmark and "Verified" text.
Consider adding a timestamp for when the email was last verified.

Email Input Enhancement:
Add email format validation in real-time as the user types.
Consider adding a confirmation email field to prevent typos.

Security:
Add rate limiting for the "Send verification link" button to prevent abuse.
Show a countdown timer after sending a verification link to indicate when the user can request another one.

User Experience:
Add a loading state when the verification email is being sent.
Consider adding a tooltip explaining why email verification is important.

Multiple Emails:
The UI has an "Add" button (PlusOutlined) but no implementation for managing multiple emails.
Consider implementing a list of emails with the ability to:
Set a primary email
Remove non-primary emails
Show verification status for each

Error Handling:
Add more specific error messages for different scenarios (e.g., email already in use, invalid domain, etc.)
Add a resend verification option if the email is unverified.

Accessibility:
Add proper ARIA labels for screen readers.
Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly for all interactive elements.
